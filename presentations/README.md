# Weekly Presentation Updates

This part of the repository is dedicated to maintaining and updating a **single slideshow** that is presented weekly to our professor. Each week, the slideshow will be revised to include new content, updates, or results based on our ongoing project progress.

## Weekly Process

1. **Update the slideshow** with new material each week.
2. **Export the slideshow as a PDF**.
3. **Upload the updated PDF** to this GitHub repository.
