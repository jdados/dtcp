If we go with square waves , which should be possible as the DDS seems to have comparator built in for that purpose, there is this driver available which should be capable of running up to 43MHz.
For our use case of this device a 12V supply voltage is good enough. 
The paper I referenced earlier was written in 2004 but it seems solutions for the problems of HF drivers have appeared more recently.
Square waves are preferred over sine waves when using Class-E amplifiers as we want to reduce the time we are in the saturation region of the MOSFET for efficiency reasons.
Class-E amplifiers unlike other classes of amplifiers need the MOSFET to act like a switch rather than a linear amplifier which is why it prefers square waves over sine waves.
If we do use sine waves we would need to double the Vpp of what we would otherwise use in a square wave which can be a little annoying. 

Need to compare EPC2065 (GaN FET) to the IRF510 (Si MOSFET)

May need a buck to reduce voltage efficiently as GaN FET is driven using a 6Vpp
