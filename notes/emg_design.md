- ports (connections):
	- ground
	- vdd
	- channel
	- SPI

- components:
	- amplifiers (?)
	- filters (?)

- chip: ADS1299
	- not a microcontroller (external programming)
	- SPI interface
	- provides amplification
	- can provide low-pass filtering
- use the MCU of the design, MSPM0C1104, to program the ADS1299
